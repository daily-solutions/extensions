    <!--
    This demo shows how you can use an Excalidraw-powered whiteboard in a Daily Prebuilt room.

    You can use this extension with your own Daily domain and room with query params. You can also
    set the Excalidraw board session by visiting https://excalidraw.com, clicking "Live Collaboration",
    and starting a live session. You'll get a URL that looks like "https://excalidraw.com/#room={longstring}". Set that longstring to the "board" param:
    `excalidraw.html?domain=yourdomain&room=yourroom&board={longstring}`
    
    To try it, open this page in a browser tab, then click the "Draw" button in the toolbar. You
    should see a whiteboard appear on the left side.
