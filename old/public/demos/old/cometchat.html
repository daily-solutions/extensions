    <!--
    This demo shows how you can embed a CometChat iframe in Daily Prebuilt.
    For the best experience, make sure to disable Daily's built-in chat
    from the room settings in your Dashboard.
    
    The extension creates new CometChat users for each person that joins the
    Daily room based on their Daily name. For real-world use cases, you'll
    probably want to change that to use your own user model.
    
    The extension also creates a CometChat 'group' named after the Daily room.
    This is how the chat persists between sessions in the same room.
