    <title>Daily.co Iframe Demo</title>

    <!--
    This demo shows how you can embed an Iframe next to a Daily Prebuilt room.
    
    You can use this extension with your own Daily domain and room with query params:
    `mediaplayer.html?domain=yourdomain&room=yourroom`
    
    To try it, open this page in a browser tab, then click the "Play Video" button in the toolbar.
    Enter a URL to a video file or RTMP stream and click OK to start playback. Unfortunately,
    playback isn't supported in Prebuilt at the moment, but if you open a separate page with
    a custom UI (such as our React example app) pointed to the same room, you'll see and hear
    the video playback.
