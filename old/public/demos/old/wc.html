    This demo shows how you can use an Whiteboard.chat board in a Daily Prebuilt room.
    
    You can use this extension with your own Daily domain and room with query params. You can also
    use your own Whiteboard.chat account by setting the `key` param to your API key from the
    whiteboard.chat site. Obviously, in production you'd want to hide that key. You'll also need
    someone to join using the `teacher` param set to true to be able to start the boards:
    `wc.html?domain=yourdomain&room=yourroom&key={yourkey}&teacher=true`
    
    To try it, open this page in a browser tab, making sure to add `teacher=true` to the URL. Then
    click the "Boards" button in the toolbar. You can join in other tabs without `teacher=true` to
    see the boards appear and disappear for the students.
