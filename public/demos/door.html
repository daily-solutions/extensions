    <!--
    This demo shows how you can implement a "door" to temporarily prevent
    other people from joining a room, even if they have a valid meeting token.
    
    The door extension requires an external presence server. To try it on your
    own computer, you'll need to follow the instructions in README.rd to run
    the test server locally.
    
    You can use this extension with your own Daily domain and room with query params:
    `door.html?domain=yourdomain&room=yourroom`
    
    To try it, open this page in a browser tab. You should join the meeting immediately.
    Once you're in, click the "door" button to close the door. (The button won't change
    state because of a temporary bug.) Then, try opening this same page in another browser
    tab. You should see a message telling you the door is closed. When you click the "door"
    button in the first tab again, your second tab should automatically join the room.
