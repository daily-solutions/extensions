    <!--
    This demo shows how you can prevent someone from idling in a room by themselves
    if they are waiting on someone else. When another person arrives, the first
    person will "pounce" on them, and they will both join the room together.
    
    The pounce extension requires an external presence server. To try it on your
    own computer, you'll need to follow the instructions in README.rd to run
    the test server locally.
    
    You can use this extension with your own Daily domain and room with query params:
    `pounce.html?domain=yourdomain&room=yourroom`
    
    To try it, open this page in a browser tab. You should see a message indicating that
    no one else is here yet. Then, opening this same page in another browser tab. When
    you do, both tabs should join the Daily room. If you close one of the tabs, the other
    tab should return to the waiting page.
